This application aims to solve as a rudimentary buffer for [The News](https://thenews.im/) as there is no proper client for this application on Android.
As a solution, I opted to produce a Progressive Web Application solution to solve for this market gap.

Currently using RSS Technology to aggregate feeds and are limited to 10 items per site, using [RSS2JSON](https://rss2json.com) as a proxy server convert XML format of RSS feeds to JSON for application.

See app [here](//bunny.zigmundsunoo.com).
